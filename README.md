# user-role-prediction
This is the code for the paper "Predicting User Roles in Social Networks using Transfer Learning with Feature Transformation" in ICDMW'16.

## Reproducing the Results

For reproduction [Stu](https://github.com/kunegis/stu) is recommended. 
If you have it installed you just need to perform:

    stu

It will automatically download the wiki-talk datasets and do analysis. 
(You would need necessary Python packages installed.)

## Datasets

Download the wiki-talk datasets using:

    stu @dataset

Alternatively the datasets can be obtained at [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/record/49561/files/wiki-talk-dataset.tar.gz).
If you want the up-to-date wiki-talk datasets you can follow the instruction [here](https://west.uni-koblenz.de/sites/default/files/publications/wiki-talk-description.pdf).
